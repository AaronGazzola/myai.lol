Refer to @docs/Roadmap_prompt.md and create a roadmap at @docs/roadmap_3-Oct-25 
The roadmap should describe the process to implement the refactor described below. Refer to @CLAUDE.md and @docs/util.md for programming patterns.
- Remove the "AI Image Analysis Workflow" section including the dropzone.
- The interface should only include the prompt cards
- Remove the plus icons from the top right of the prompt cards
- Remove the title from the prompt card and replace it with the "Technique" select element
- Some techniques have sub-categories (example: Few-shot learning has options for object counting, object identification and classification), when a technique is selected that contains sub-categories then an additional sub-category select element should be included to the right of the technique select element. Remove the sub-category selection UI from other locations in the prompt card.
- Below each prompt card should be a plus icon button that allows another prompt card to be inserted below. This should allow a card to be inserted between two existing cards
- Remove the "multi-step prompting" option from the "technique" select element 
- In the same level as the "Prompt workflow" title on the far right side should be a button with text: "start sequence" and a play button on the right.
- At the bottom right of each prompt card should be a "submit single prompt" button with a send icon on the right
- When the "few-shot learning" technique is selected, the left side of the prompt card should have a prompt text area above an image dropzone. The right side of the card should have another image dropzone. The user can drop one target image on the left side and up to 4 example images on the right side. The four images on the right side should be displayed as a grid. Clicking on one of the images should open a sheet component with the full size image, clicking on the image in the sheet should place markers on the image and record the coordinates of the markers in relation to the image. The sheet should have next and previous chevron icon buttons on the left and right to page through each of the images, allowing the user to assign markers to each. The "submit single prompt" button should become enabled when an image is included in the left section along with a prompt, and at least one image is included in the right section with markers applied. When submitted, a server action should create a copy of the provided example images with visual markers added at the provided coordinates. The prompt, the target image and the example images should be used to complete the image identification process.
