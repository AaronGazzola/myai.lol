- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for full workflow testing
- **Visual Tests**: Screenshot testing for UI consistency
- **Performance Tests**: Lighthouse CI for performance monitoring
- **Technique Validation**: Test each technique with real-world examples

### Documentation Updates

### Data Flow

1. **Image Upload**: User drags images → DropZone processes → ImageStore updates → ImageGallery displays
2. **Technique Selection**: User selects technique → PromptCard updates → TechniqueBuilder renders
3. **Technique Configuration**: User configures → TechniqueEngine validates → PromptFormatter structures
4. **AI Request**: User submits → OpenRouter API called → PromptFormatter creates request → Response processed
5. **Response Display**: AI responds → ResponseProcessor formats → ResponseCard renders with confidence
6. **Sequence Continuation**: User continues → Context extracted → Next PromptCard receives context
7. **Workflow Execution**: User runs workflow → RequestQueue processes sequentially → Context passed between cards

### State Management Strategy

- **Local Component State**: UI interactions and temporary data
- **Context Providers**: Shared state across component tree
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulate stateful logic and API calls
- **Persistence**: LocalStorage for workflows, preferences, and API keys

### Technique Workflow Examples

**Example 1: Few-Shot Object Counting**

```
Card 1: Few-Shot Learning
  - Example 1: [schematic with 3 toilets] → "3 toilets"
  - Example 2: [schematic with 1 toilet] → "1 toilet"
  - Example 3: [schematic with 5 toilets] → "5 toilets"
  - Target: [new schematic] → AI analyzes

Card 2: Multi-Step Verification (receives Card 1 response)
  - Step 1: "Review your count from the previous analysis"
  - Step 2: "Double-check each bathroom area"
  - Step 3: "Provide final verified count"
```

**Example 2: Comparative Multi-Image Analysis**

```
Card 1: Multi-Image Context
  - Reference: [image of typical toilet fixtures]
  - Target: [schematic to analyze]
  - Context: "Use reference to identify similar fixtures"

Card 2: Visual Pointing (receives Card 1 response)
  - Marked regions on schematic
  - "For each marked area, verify the fixture type"

Card 3: Summary (receives Card 2 response)
  - "Provide final count with confidence level"
```

This enhanced roadmap provides a comprehensive implementation plan for building a sophisticated AI image analysis application with advanced prompt engineering techniques. The workflow system enables users to construct powerful, multi-step analysis pipelines that combine few-shot learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, visual pointing, and multi-image context for maximum accuracy and flexibility.
